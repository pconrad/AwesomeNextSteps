The next steps towards Project Awesome

# Things you need to know!

* Project Awesome uses submodules
** Submodules are "repos inside repos"--essentially "symbolic links" to other repos containing libraries that this project depends on.
* So, after you clone this repo, always do this first:
** git submodule init
** git submodule update
* Those two commands populate the subdirectories with the submodule contents.


# What's new?

We will start RIGHT from the beginning with

* multiple output formats in mind---HTML, Moodle XML.
* everything generated from a seed


# What will be our first exercise?
